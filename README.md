# To Train
1. Download the checkpoint from [seg_model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1J_XiTRoZbSJ38Qxw2hVrYg?pwd=1wfb) and put it into `'./pretrained/'`.
2. run 'train.py'

# To Test
1. Download the checkpoint from [fusion_model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HAFM9ms8vsh8i1lbzPXpMQ?pwd=fhqf) and put it into `'./models/'`.
2. Place the paired test images in the folder `'./image/'.`
3. The result data_root are put in `'./Results/'`.
   
Then run `test.py`.
